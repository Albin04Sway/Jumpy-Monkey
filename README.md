# Jumpy Monkey
Inspired by the popular game Flappy Bird, Jumpy Monkey is a fun and addictive game with countless randomised obstacles and an inbuilt score count system.
With gravity acting down on Jumpy Monkey, the player must hit their spacebar to make him jump through all the forest obstacles. For each obstacle he gets through, the player receives 1 point.
The game ends once Jumpy Monkey hits an obstacle or falls from the window.
Once the game is over, the game can be instantly restarted with the hit of a spacebar!
